Segolene Royal reignited her row with the French First Lady last night when she blamed Valerie Trierweiler for her presidential election defeat to Nicolas Sarkozy. The pair had becomed embroiled in a political spat last week when it emerged that Miss Trierweiler had tweeted support for a politician standing against Miss Royal, 58, in parliamentary elections. A presidential aide said Miss Trierweiler, 47 – nicknamed the Rottweiler – had since been told to ‘stay in the shadows’ because president Francois Hollande was ‘furious’ at her intervention. Backtrack: France's controversial new first lady Valerie Trierweiler (left) now 'regrets' humiliating the mother of the President's four children Segolene Royal (right) But the row dubbed the 'the war of the . roses' erupted again last night when Miss Royal, who said she was . 'wounded' by the 'violent blow', claimed Miss Trierweiler had been . undermining her career for years since starting a relationship with her . ex-partner. Miss Segolene, the mother of President . Hollande's four children, had already accused senior Socialist . politicians of not being supportive enough in her 2007 campaign. But she went a step further in an . interview with French weekly Le Point yesteryday, claiming France's . first lady had kept Mr Hollande away from her during the campaign. She said: 'I realise that in 2007 (Mr . Hollande's affair with Trierweiler) can't have helped matters. I now . understand why François didn't help me. 'In 2007, I said to myself: 'It will pass, it'll work itself out.' So I took it on the chin.' Miss Royal is said to have told friends that Miss Trierweiler is a 'traitor' who her treated her disgracefully. Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter to announce her support for socialist Olivier Falorni . Miss Royal said it was unfair that . Miss Trierweiler had been allowed to carry on writing about Mr Hollande . in her 'Paris Match' arts column. Miss Royal told Le Point: 'In an . Anglo-Saxon country, she would have been fired the same day. But Paris . Match was not unhappy to see me weakened, so they let (the relationship) go on deliberately, just like all those others who knew ...(Paris Match . owner) Lagardère, Sarkozy.' Her outburst finished when she claimed that 'I'm the one whose family has been broken, I'm, the one who should bear a grudge.' France's first lady said last night she regretted humiliating the mother of the president’s four children. Mr Hollande, who lived with Miss Royal . for 30 years, wanted to make her the speaker of the National Assembly . but backed down when she lost the election. Telling off: Following Valerie Trierweiler's (pictured right) Twitter comments, Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 'everyone should know their place' A friend of Miss Trierweiler said she admitted: ‘I made a mistake.’ The friend added: ‘She did not calculate the consequences.’ Ms Trierweiler, who has been divorced . twice, has three sons of her own and said that the only reason she had . not travelled to Mexico with Hollande for the G8 meeting was because . they have exams this week. Intriguingly, Ms Trierweiler's . personal biography has disappeared from the Elysee Palace website, but . another aide insisted that it was 'being edited' and would return. But the same aide confirmed that Ms . Trierweiler was being encouraged to 'remain in the shadows'  because Ms . Hollande was 'furious' at the way she has behaved so far. Glamour: Hollande initially painted himself as an antidote to the flash previous President Nicolas Sarkozy, who married model Carla Bruni . Referring to the tweet, he said 'clearly this cannot happen again'. Despite the continuing saga which has . reduced the Elysee to a soap opera, journalist Ms Trierweiler's arts . column is set to appear in Paris Match magazine this week. And she has insisted she will not give up her Twitter account. Mr Hollande has now refused to give Ms Royal a job because she lost the La Rochelle seat in western France so heavily. But, despite consistent defeats since . being rejected for the presidency in 2007, Ms Royal insists that she can . revive her political career.",Valerie Trierweiler tweeted support for a politician standing against Segolene Royal in parliamentary elections.

A spinoff from robotic space technology may someday help astronauts stay fit in space and help paraplegics walk on Earth, Nasa says. The U.S. space agency and the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) have jointly developed a robotic exoskeleton called X1. The 57lb device is a robot that a human could wear over his or her body either to assist or inhibit movement in leg joints. Scroll down for video . Dual use: The X1 exoskeleton, currently in development, could help astronauts exercise in space and paraplegics walk on Earth. It is based on the technology behind Robonaut 2, the first humanoid robot in space . In the inhibit mode, the X1 exoskeleton would be used as an in-space exercise machine to supply resistance against leg movement. The same technology could be used in reverse on the ground, potentially helping some individuals walk for the first time. The X1 is based on the technology behind Robonaut 2, the first humanoid robot in space, which is currently working with astronauts aboard the International Space Station. 'Robotics is playing a key role aboard the International Space Station and will be critical in our future human exploration of deep space,' said Michael Gazarik, director of Nasa's Space Technology Program. 'What's extraordinary about space technology and our work with projects like Robonaut are the unexpected possibilities space tech spinoffs may have right here on Earth. 'It's exciting to see a Nasa-developed technology might one day help people with serious ambulatory needs to begin to walk again, or even walk for the first time. 'That's the sort of return on investment Nasa is proud to give back to America and the world.' Nasa's Robonaut 2 aboard the International Space Station: The technology for the X1 exoskeleton was adapted from the Robonaut project . From the waist up, 27-year-old Sophie Morgan is every inch the pretty blonde girl-next-door. But from the waist down, with her legs encased in £90,000 of motorised carbon-fibre, she is RoboCop. Sophie’s thumb manipulates a joystick built into the armrests of her suit, causing the legs to hiss and whirr into life, before she takes three slow but sure steps. Her face breaks into a broad grin. Nasa's X1 prototype is not the only exoskeleton in development that could help disabled people walk again. Sophie is one of the first people in the world to benefit from a robotic exoskeleton called Rex. Once in, the only movement needed is the strength to operate a small joystick, which instructs 29 micro-controllers within the machine to react within milliseconds. The user can move in all directions, sit down, and ascend and descend stairs. It is this technology that will, arguably, mark the end of the wheelchair. But as yet there are currently just ten in existence and only 30 people have tried Rex. Rex weighs nearly 6st and is relatively bulky, yet experts predict that within the next few decades the devices will be small and light enough to slip on under a pair of jeans. Worn over the legs, with a harness . that reaches up the back and around the shoulders, X1 has four motorised . joints at the hips and the knees, and six passive joints that allow for . sidestepping, turning and pointing, and flexing a foot. There also are multiple adjustment points, allowing the X1 to be used in many different ways. Nasa is examining the potential for the X1 as an exercise device to improve crew health both aboard the space station and during future long-duration missions to an asteroid or Mars. Without taking up valuable space or weight during missions, X1 could replicate common crew exercises, which are vital to keeping astronauts healthy in zero gravity. In addition, the device has the ability to measure, record and stream back data in real-time to flight controllers on Earth, giving doctors better insight into the crew's exercise. X1 could also provide a robotic power boost to astronauts as they work on the surface of distant planetary bodies. Coupled with a spacesuit, X1 could provide additional force when needed during surface exploration. Here on Earth, IHMC is interested in developing and using X1 as an assistive walking device. It has the potential to produce high torques to allow for assisted walking over varied terrain, as well as stair climbing. 'We greatly value our collaboration with Nasa,' said Ken Ford, IHMC's director and CEO. 'The X1's high-performance capabilities will enable IHMC to continue performing cutting-edge research in mobility assistance and expand into rehabilitation.' The potential of X1 extends to other applications, including rehabilitation, gait modification and offloading large amounts of weight from the wearer. Preliminary studies by IHMC have already shown X1 to be more comfortable, easier to adjust, and easier to put on than older exoskeleton devices. Researchers now plan on improving on the X1 design by adding more active joints to areas such as the ankle and hip to increase the potential uses for the device.","Nasa and Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition have jointly developed a robotic exoskeleton called X1.

2,"A father who imported a stun gun disguised as an iPhone  walked free from court yesterday. John Liddiatt, 40, ordered the device online while browsing collectible replica weapons. But when suspicious customs officers investigated the parcel from Singapore they found the replica iPhone and immediately passed it to the police. Walking free: John Liddiatt (pictured) was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for a year . Officers confirmed the device was a weapon and it was re-wrapped before being delivered to Liddiatt at his home address. The dad-of-three was immediately arrested and confessed he had ordered the device, but claimed he had no idea it would be real because of its cheap price. Liddiatt, of Broad Walk, Knowle, Bristol, admitted one count of acquiring a disguised firearm at Bristol Crown Court and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for a year. The black phone, which is in a cover, came with a charger and has two prongs in the bottom which act as pins for the stun gun. Sentencing, Judge Martin Picton told him: 'It is a pretty poor imitation of an iPhone of some description in a box that is meant to look real.' The court heard how weapon collector Liddiatt ordered the stun gun on December 5 2013 from a website he usually used to purchase replica items. George Threlfall, prosecuting, said: 'On December 19 a package was sent from Singapore, addressed to Liddiatt at his home address. 'It was intercepted by customs and officers opened it and revealed what they believed to be a stun gun device. 'This was passed on to police and following examination, firearms officers who confirmed it was a stun gun with the appearance of a mobile phone.' Police then re-packaged the device before an officer, dressed as a postman, delivered it to Liddiatt's home. Unrealistic: Judge Martin Picton told Liddiatt: 'It is a pretty poor imitation of an iPhone of some description in a box that is meant to look real' Weapon: The black phone, which is in a cover, comes with a charger and has two prongs in the bottom which act as pins for the stun gun . He told officers he was an avid collector of replica crossbows, swords and masks which had appeared in movies and did not realise it was an offence to import the stun gun. Jane Chamberlin, defending Liddiatt, said: 'We have a defendant who has kept the item under the stairs and who volunteered it to police. 'It was not going to be put out in the public domain.' After the sentencing, Avon and Somerset police warned of the risks of importing illegal weapons over the internet. Investigating officer PC Chris Downham said: 'It is imperative that items bought from abroad and imported into this country are legal according to UK laws. 'Stun guns like the ones seized in this case are prohibited and dangerous weapons capable of causing considerable harm. 'It's the responsibility of the buyer to ensure they are complying with the law before ordering items over the internet. 'Liddiatt had tested the items when they arrived and was fully aware they were a viable working device.' Liddiatt was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.","John Liddiatt, 40, ordered the device online while browsing collectible replica weapons.

Three human skeletons discovered in a hole dug for a septic tank in Oklahoma last month are most likely those of three females we went missing in 1992 authorities have announced. Grover J. Prewitt Jr., 60, of Bristow was arrested on Thursday after having admitted to police of having sprinkled black pepper over the grave to mask any odor, but under the direction of his mother he claims. The bodies are likely Wendy Camp, 23; her daughter Cynthia Britto, 6; and Lisa Kregear, 22, who was Camp's sister-in-law, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said. Missing: From left Wendy Camp, 23, her daughter Cynthia Britto, 6, and Lisa Kregear, 22, are pictured after vanishing on May 29 of 1992 . Clothing, a backpack and a purse were found in the 8-feet-deep hole near Jennings, matching items the women had when they disappeared on May 29 of 1992. Prewitt used to own the land where the bodies were found and was charged with being an accessory after the fact of first-degree murder. Investigators said he told them that he suspected in 1992 that the three were in the hole and said he spread pepper in the area at his mother's request. Prewitt's mother, Ida Prewitt who died in September of 2011, was in a bitter custody battle with Camp at the time of her disappearance having been married to Prewitt's nephew, according to investigators. In late March, Grover Prewitt told investigators that, around the time the three disappeared, his sister Beverly Noe asked him to hire a backhoe driver to dig a hole for a septic tank on 5 acres that their mother was buying from him. Accessory: Grover J. Prewitt Jr., 60, of Bristow, told police his mother Ida Prewitt, right, ordered him to dig the hole for a septic tank where the bodies were later found . The hole sat empty for a bit, then after the three went missing his mother asked him to have the backhoe driver fill the hole. Ida Prewitt never moved onto the property and later sold it. 'Grover never looked in the hole after the girls went missing because he was scared of what he would see,' agent Melissa Gann wrote in an affidavit filed in Creek County Court. Investigators have since accused Noe of being the last to have seen the three victims after driving them to Walmart. 'I never hurt nobody,' Noe told KFOR. 'I took ‘em to the Walmart. I’ll say that to my dying days.' Five days after his initial meeting with police, Prewitt met again with investigators and told one 'he really needed to look in that hole.' On April 16, crews found three bodies inside. In an interview with police on April 22, he recalled his mother asking him to sprinkle black pepper on the area. Scene: The remains were found on this private property in Pawnee County last month in an 8-foot hole that Grover Prewitt says his mother told him to sprinkle black pepper over to mask any odor . 'He told her he thought that was ""awful damn strange."" She said it would ""deter dog scents."" Grover did not question her on that matter and did as he was asked,' Gann wrote. 'He also remembered Ida saying one time she ""took care"" of those three people,' Gann wrote. Ida Prewitt died in September 2011, the investigators said. The OSBI wouldn't speculate on why Grover Prewitt stepped forward now. 'After 21 years, a lot changes in people's lives,' OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown said. Creek County officials did not have a record of any attorney for Prewitt. DNA testing is pending to determine definitely whether the bodies are those of the missing women and the girl. 'Now that it is open and out in the public, we need people to come forward,' she said. 'There are other people who know about this.' At a news conference Thursday, OSBI Director Stan Florence credited Prewitt's recent revelations – at the same time agents were moving in to arrest him. 'The passage of 21 years gave a tipster confidence to come forward and provide the information necessary to help push this case forward,' Florence said at the time. According to the investigators, Camp's son, 4-year-old Jonathan Noe, lived with Chad Noe in Shamrock. Chad Noe's mother, Beverly Noe, told investigators in 1992 that she drove the three to and from Shamrock, then dropped them off at a Wal-Mart in Chandler. Jennings is about 100 miles northeast of Oklahoma City and the grave site is about 19 miles from Shamrock and 30 miles from Chandler.","Grover J.

The owner of the scandal-hit Godolphin stable has ordered a new investigation after banned equine drugs were discovered on a Dubai government private jet when it was searched at Stansted airport. Officers from the UK Border Agency, along with the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, seized the unlicensed products from a Dubai Royal Air Wing flight earlier this year, it has been reported. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, monarch of the gulf emirate, has now ordered his junior wife Her Highness Princess Haya, president of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports, to carry out an investigation into the incident. The inquiry comes just weeks after a separate raid at Moorley Farm in Newmarket, which is owned by Godolphin’s Darley Management operation. According to The Guardian, the shipment, apparently labelled as 'horse tack', did not include anabolic steroids. It is believed the seizure did however contain products used on endurance horses. A spokesman for Princess Haya told the Guardian: 'Nobody seems to know in the organisation who is buying what or where. That’s one of the reforms that they want in place.' The spokesman said Sheik Mohammed had been unaware of the products on the flight as well as the raid at Moorley Farm. The spokesman also said Sheikh Mohammed's operation had not been spoken to by the VMD since the seizure and blamed the presence of the drugs on 'an internal reporting error'. Sheikh Mohammed's senior wife is Shaikha Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma Al Maktoum, a member of Dubai's ruling family Al Maktoum, who he married in 1979. His most famous junior wife is Princess Haya, who he married on April 10, 2004. Statement: A spokesman for Princess Haya (right) has said Sheikh Mohammed's (left) operation had not been spoken to by the VMD since the seizure . The British Horseracing Authority has . said it has been told by Defra there was no link between the seizure . and the racing industry. Adam . Brickell, the BHA's director of integrity, legal and risk, said: 'This . issue is a matter for Defra and the VMD, the agency responsible for . issues concerning the use and manufacture of veterinary medicines in . Britain. 'On account of our existing working . relationship with Defra and the VMD, as fellow regulatory authorities . with responsibilities for animals and their welfare, the BHA was . notified of the seizure of veterinary care products, some of which are . not licensed for use in the UK. 'Defra . have confirmed to the BHA that they consider there to be no link . between the seizure and the racing industry and that the products were . not intended for use on thoroughbreds.' A Border Force spokesman said the products seized at Stansted had now been destroyed. The spokesman told MailOnline: 'On May 3 Border Force officers at Stansted identified a quantity of veterinary products on a private plane that arrived at the airport. 'The products, which were unlicensed, had been listed as horse tack and were seized by officers. Illegal drug use: Former Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni was banned for eight years after anabolic steroids were used on 22 horses in the stable . 'DEFRA (the Department for Environment, . Food and Rural Affairs) was contacted and confirmed Border Force . officers' identification of the medicines, which were subsequently . removed and destroyed. 'Border Force officers are on constant . alert to keep unlicensed, fake and illegal items from entering the . country — including veterinary products.' In April, former Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni was banned for eight years after anabolic steroids were used on 22 horses in the stable. Earlier this month it was reported Sheikh Mohammed was embroiled in another drugs controversy after 124 unauthorised veterinary products were seized at Moorley Farm East in Newmarket. The farm, which is owned by Darley Stud, the banner company of his breeding operation, was the subject of a swoop in August by DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) and is a base for endurance horses owned by the Sheik’s family. It is unknown whether the seizure at Stansted and the raid at Moorley Farm are connected.","Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has ordered an investigation into the seizure.

Met Office experts who got together to discuss recent unusual weather patterns predicted yesterday that Britain faces a decade of wet summers. They blame natural warming in the Atlantic for pushing a current of fast-flowing air in the upper atmosphere, known as the jet stream, further south. People being rescued from the 2007 Summer floods in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. Britain could be subjected to wet summers for at least another decade, weather experts have today warned .

Professor Stephen Belcher, Head of the Met Office Hadley Centre and chair of the meeting, said: 'Ultimately what we’ve seen in each of these seasons is shifts in the position of the jet stream which impact our weather in certain ways at different times of year. 'The key question is what is causing the jet stream to shift in this way? There is some research to say some parts of the natural system load the dice to influence certain states of the jet stream, but this loading may be further amplified by climate change.' Brendan Jones, senior forecaster at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, . said tomorrow's warm weather was being carried by warm air coming up from the .

'The key question is what is causing the jet stream to shift in this way? 'There is some research to say some parts of the natural system load the dice to influence certain the jet stream, but this loading may be further amplified by climate change.' There are a number of possible factors which could be ‘loading the dice’, including declining Arctic sea ice, solar variability and long-term ocean cycles. The workshop focused on the latest research looking at how these drivers can influence weather patterns and discussed future research can be targeted to push forward understanding in this area. There are a wide range of factors that could be causing the cold winters such as changes in the Arctic climate. Dr James Screen, from the University of Exeter, said: 'There has been a lot of talk about declining Arctic sea ice playing a role in our weather patterns, but really that’s just one aspect of changes in the Arctic climate – which has seen rapid warming compared to other parts of the world. 'Those changes mean there is less of a difference in temperature between the Arctic and tropics, which could impact the position of the jet stream.' Another driver of colder winter weather has already been identified and is known as Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs). Recent research in this area has meant the Met Office was able to give good advice up to a month ahead on cold spells in recent seasons when they have been driven by this phenomenon. Professor Belcher said: 'This workshop has looked at some really cutting edge research and helped us identify key areas for future work to improve our understanding of potential drivers of some of the unusual seasons we have seen. 'This work will help us continue our work to push forward understanding in this area so we can give better forecasts and advice on longer timescales in the future.'Source: Met Office .","Six out of the last seven UK summers have seen above average rainfall. It is thought that long-term Atlantic currents could be to blame. Britain could be subjected to wet summers for at least another decade, weather experts have today warned. They blame natural warming in the Atlantic for pushing a current of fast-flowing air in the upper atmosphere.",1351,59,0.432,0.814
8,"(CNN) -- When CNN highlighted some excellent historic restaurants in major cities across the country last month, readers wondered why their small-town and smaller-city favorites didn't make the cut. Thus, in this follow-up tribute to more laudable veteran restaurants, we've zeroed in -- thanks to suggestions from our commenters -- on the decades-old, and in certain cases centuries-old, icons that thrive outside of America's biggest metropolises. Columbia Restaurant, 1905 . The Hernandez/Gonzmart family claims the title of Florida's oldest restaurant and America's oldest Spanish restaurant with their 107-year-old icon Columbia in the Ybor City area of Tampa. What started as a corner cafe for the cigar workers in town has ballooned into a 1,700-seat restaurant specializing in Cuban and Spanish cuisine. Live jazz and flamenco shows are offered on most nights, and the gift shop comes complete with cigar rolling demonstrations in the afternoon. The restaurant expanded with locations across Florida -- including one in Tampa International Airport -- but the locals still stop in here for the famous Cuban sandwiches, the 1905 salad, tossed tableside and the old-school Spanish decor. 2117 East 7th Avenue, Tampa, Florida (813) 248-4961 . Louis' Lunch, 1895 . The supposed originator of the hamburger, Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut, has been serving beef patties on white toast since before buns were even invented. Legend has it that in 1900, a customer asked the restaurant's founder, Louis Lassen, for a quick meal he could eat on the run. He broiled some steak trimmings, put them between two slices of bread, and voila, the burger was born. Over a hundred years later the lunch wagon has evolved into a squat, Victorian-looking restaurant, featuring wooden chairs and carved graffiti-ridden tables and a menu offering just four items: burgers, potato chips, potato salad and pie. The patties are placed on vertical, antique 1898 cast iron grills that cook the burgers on both sides simultaneously to medium rare. And don't ask for ketchup. Only three condiments are offered: cheese spread, tomatoes and onions. 261-263 Crown Street, New Haven, Connecticut (203) 562-5507 . Samoa Cookhouse, 1893 . Back in the heyday of logging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, companies set up cookhouses to feed their workers. These mess halls/community centers offered three hot meals a day (and cold meals on Sundays) for an affordable price, served family style. The Louisiana-Pacific Samoa Cookhouse in Samoa, California, began as one such kitchen in 1893 and continues the tradition of serving affordable, family-style meals in a no-frills setting. Current menu items include French toast, pancakes and sausage for breakfast, chicken parm and pot roast for lunch, and roast beef, short ribs and ham for dinner. Those with a strong sense of nostalgia should check out the restaurant's museum on the second level, which is filled with old photographs along with logging and maritime relics. 908 Vance Avenue, Samoa, California (707) 442-1659 . Smackdown: Tampa Bay area boasts sandy shores, surrealism . Brookville Hotel, 1870 . When the Brookville Hotel, the home of famous, affordable and hearty fried chicken dinners, was forced to move locations in 2000 due to a sewage issue, the owners decided to make an exact replica of their former home, one their loyal regulars would recognize. The new version, located 40 miles away from Brookville in Abilene, Kansas, includes a rebuilt facade and as many of the old doors and fixtures from the original hotel restaurant, with origins dating back to 1870, as possible. Brookville Hotel stopped welcoming overnight guests decades ago, but the name lives on. The chicken dinner, served since the current owners' great-grandmother originated it in 1915, includes coleslaw, half a fried chicken, mashed potatoes, creamed corn, biscuits and ice cream, all for $15. 105 E. Lafayette, Abilene, Kansas (785) 263-2244 . Shady Glen, 1948 . Manchester, Connecticut, institution Shady Glen began back in 1948 as a classic soda fountain and ice cream maker, the offshoot of a dairy farm. When the original owners, John and Bernice Rieg, decided to branch out to lure business in the colder months, they added savory diner staples to their menu -- including a special take on the classic griddle-top cheeseburger featuring a giant crown (using four slices) of crispy cheese. Burgers and homemade ice cream are still served in the old diner today, which was enlarged and renovated over the decades but has kept the same look since 1978. 840 Middle Turnpike E, Manchester, Connecticut (860) 649-4245 . Cold Springs Tavern, 1886 . Cold Springs Tavern, founded in 1886 on a site established as a stagecoach stop in the 1860s, is located 20 minutes north of Santa Barbara, California, nestled on a mountainside off a winding road. Its buildings, a group of low log cabins outfitted with fireplaces, taxidermy and animal hides, have been preserved through the decades, making this a local destination, even without much signage or promotion. The place is big with bikers, especially on Sundays when live music is offered and the Log Cabin Bar offers their locally famous tri-tip steak sandwiches. 5995 Stagecoach Rd., Santa Barbara, California (805) 967-0066 . Race for the next presidential birthplace . Red Fox Inn and Tavern, 1728 . Those looking for an old Colonial experience should seek out the Red Fox Inn and Tavern, right in the middle of Northern Virginia's hunt country. Founded in 1728, the inn housed presidents and Revolutionary War heroes, was a medical center for the Confederate Army during the Civil War, and has attracted famed guests like Jackie Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor. The tavern looks as it might have in the 18th century, with thick stone walls, large fireplaces, beamed low ceilings and long oak tables. The menu changes seasonally but features old Southern classics like fried chicken, crab cakes and peanut soup. 2 East Washington Street, Middleburg, Virginia (540) 687-6301 . Al's Restaurant, 1925 . A guide to old-school American restaurants wouldn't be complete without a grand steakhouse, and Al's Restaurant, a St. Louis fixture since 1925, fits the bill. Stepping inside the restaurant, located in an unassuming building by the city's waterfront, is like entering a time warp. Though Al's began as an outpost selling egg sandwiches to the dock workers nearby, the founders' son transformed it into a fine-dining chop house with white tablecloths, wood paneled walls and a verbal menu -- servers come around with raw cuts of meat and fish to choose from -- of chops, steaks and seafood. It's not cheap by any stretch, but Al's is a staple in the area and is run by the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the original immigrant founders. 1200 North 1st St., St. Louis, Missouri (314) 421-6399 . Chef Vola's, 1921 . Up until the 1980s, when the current owners bought it, Chef Vola's had no phone number, no signage and survived for 60 years in the basement of an Atlantic City row house strictly by word of mouth. Though it's a little easier to access now, reservations are still tough to come by, with good reason. The setting is unique in that it feels like someone's home -- until recently diners had to walk through the dishwashing area to get to the bathroom -- and the vibe is that of a large family gathering. And then there's the food: fettuccine in clam sauce, a primal-sized veal parmigiana on the bone, steak charred ""Pittsburgh style,"" famed banana cream and caramel ricotta pies, and dozens of others delectables. Try calling the day of to see if there are any cancellations, and note it's BYOB and cash only. 111 S. Albion Pl., Atlantic City, New Jersey (609) 345-2022 . Oktoberfest closer to home: Five U.S. festivals . The Bright Star, 1907 . A large contingent of customers have been coming to The Bright Star, a 105-year-old casual Greek/Southern restaurant in downtown Bessemer, Alabama, for decades. A large contingent of the restaurant's workers have been there even longer. And its owners, Nicky and Jimmy Koikos, one of whom is there almost every shift, have been keeping the family tradition alive since 1966. Why all the dedication? First there's the fresh seafood, trucked in from the Gulf Coast daily and served with a Greek flair. But also, it serves as a community gathering place and hub for Bessemer locals, growing from a 25-seat cafe to a 330-seat restaurant over the decades. Specialties include the seafood gumbo, the Greek snapper and the lemon ice box pie. 304 19th St. North, Bessemer, Alabama (205) 424-9444 .

9,"(CNN) -- Japanese golf prodigy Ryo Ishikawa has announced he will donate his tournament earnings from 2011 to the victims of the tsunami which recently devastated the Asian country. Ishikawa, 19, will also give $1,200 for every birdie he achieves during the year and the world number 45 is planning a tour of the severely effected Tohuku area of Honshu Island. ""I feel thrilled. My goal is 200 million yen [$2.4 million],"" Ishikawa is reported as saying by news agency AFP. The Saitama-born star turned professional in 2008 and has earned in excess of $1.2 million during each of his three years in the sport, according to AFP. Ishikawa broke a world record in May 2010 when he shot the lowest-ever score in a major golf tournament with a 12-under par 58. ""I have enough money to spend for my golf. I still have savings. I believe this is the most positive way for me to spend money,"" he added. The nine-time winner in Japan finished third on the country's money list in 2010 and sought the advice of his father, who is a banker, before making the decision. Ishikawa is currently in the U.S. preparing for The Masters at Augusta in Georgia, which is due to start on April 7. The earthquake and tsunami which ravaged Japan is estimated to have claimed 18,000 lives and prompted a nuclear crisis at the stricken Fukushima plant.","Japanese golf prodigy Ryo Ishikawa will donate his tournament earnings from 2011 to the victims of the tsunami.

10,"Warsaw (CNN) -- Eleven people died and one, somehow, survived when a small aircraft belonging to a private parachute school crashed Saturday in Poland, state news reported. Firefighters learned about the crash near Czestochowa, a city some 140 kilometers (85 miles) north of Krakow, around 4:20 p.m., Polish Press Agency (PAP) reported. Czestochowa fire Capt. Pawel Liszaj told PAP that arriving firefighters found three people outside the aircraft, one of whom was still alive. ""Unfortunately, everything indicates that he is the only person who survived the crash,"" provincial police spokeswoman Joanna Lazar told CNN affiliate TVN. Authorities later discovered nine bodies inside the plane's wreckage, according to Liszaj. The survivor -- who was one of the three initially spotted outside the aircraft -- was flown by helicopter to a Czestochowa hospital, Robert Galazkowski, the head of the Polish Medical Air Rescue, told PAP. The 40-year-old man was conscious from the time he was found, though he suffered many injuries, including to his pelvis, according to the report. He was in serious but stable condition Saturday evening, Galazkowski said. The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","A small aircraft belonging to a private parachute school crashes near Czestochowa, state news reports.

11,"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:08 EST, 26 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:17 EST, 26 June 2012 . From a chapel pulpit on Lackland Air Force Base, where every American airman reports for basic training, Col. Glenn Palmer delivered his first order to nearly 600 recruits seated in the pews: If you're sexually harassed or assaulted, tell someone. 'My job is to give you a safe, effective training environment,' Palmer said firmly. What the colonel did not mention directly in his recent address was a widening sex scandal that has rocked the base, one of the nation's busiest military training centers. Victims?: Female airmen march during graduation at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio . Allegations that male instructors had sex with, and in one case raped, female trainees have led to criminal charges against four men. Charges against others are possible. The most serious accusations surround an Air Force staff sergeant scheduled to face a court-martial in July on charges that include rape and multiple counts of aggravated sexual assault. The other three defendants were charged with lesser crimes ranging from sexual misconduct to adultery. All of the defendants were assigned to turn raw recruits into airmen in eight weeks of basic training. A two-star general is now investigating alongside a separate criminal probe, which military prosecutors say could sweep up more airmen. Advocates for female service members and members of Congress have started taking notice. 'It's a pretty big scandal the Air Force is having to deal with at this point,' said Greg Jacob, a former Marine infantry officer and policy director of the Service Women's Action Network. 'It's pretty substantial in its scope.' Col. Glenn Palmer (pictured) advised recruits: If you're sexually harassed or assaulted, tell someone but did not mention the scandal . Yet there are signs the Air Force still doesn't have a handle on the full depth of the problem. Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado pleaded guilty earlier this month to having sex with a female trainee and struck a plea deal for 90 days' confinement. Then he acknowledged being involved with a total of 10 trainees — a number previously unknown to investigators. On Friday, after months of embarrassing disclosures, the head of the Air Force's training command ordered Maj. Gen. Margaret H. Woodward to lead an independent investigation. That same day, the Air Force gave reporters rare access to Lackland's instructional headquarters in an effort to show there was nothing to hide. The headquarters facility is where Lackland trains the people who train recruits. Inside one small classroom, three women and two men were lectured on the importance of having a moral compass while watching a slide presentation titled 'Integrity First'. Lackland has about 475 instructors for the nearly 36,000 airmen who will graduate this year. That's about 85 per cent of what Lackland would consider a full roster of instructors, a demanding job that requires airmen to work longer hours than most for four years, at the expense of family and personal time. The Air Force recently launched a smartphone app to help recruit instructors. Topping a page of frequently asked questions is whether the divorce rate for instructors really is higher. (The Air Force says no.) Palmer said that a slight shortage in instructors has not lowered the standards for applicants. In response to the allegations, he said instructor training is being revamped and that he was accountable for problems within the training wing. Leaders of the instructor program, however, said the responsibility falls on the accused. 'A person sitting in that seat, they're going to do what they're going to do when no one is watching,' said Master Sgt. Greg Pendleton, who oversees the training. 'That's across the board. That's just them. When we're outside this door or outside these walls, there are individuals that have their own personal values.' Military personnel stand outside the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, one of the nation's busiest military training centers, where four male instructors are charged with having sex with, and in one case raping, female trainees . So widespread is the fallout that Lackland halted operations for an entire day in March to survey about 5,900 trainees about whether they had seen or been a victim of sexual misconduct. It was a highly unusual move for a vast 15-square-mile base that runs with relentless efficiency. A new class of airmen graduates every Friday for 50 of the 52 weeks in the year. At first, Palmer, commander of the 737th training wing, said he wasn't sure that halting training was even possible. Airman Andrea Madison, a new graduate who was in basic training at the height of the investigation at Lackland, said she never felt uncomfortable with her instructors. 'They want to make sure no foul play is happening, no one is taking advantage of us,' said Madison, of Columbus, Ohio. Last week, one commander of a Lackland training squadron caught up in the sex scandal was dismissed after the Air Force lost confidence in his leadership. Col. Polly Kenny, 2nd Air Force Staff, said the dismissal was not directly related to the sexual misconduct investigation. The Service Women's Action Network supports and works with servicewomen . Nearly three dozen instructors at Lackland have also been removed in the past year, but the Air Force will not say how many lost their jobs as a result of the investigation that began last fall, only that the majority of dismissals were unrelated. The first sexual misconduct allegations at Lackland surfaced a year ago against Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, who is charged with 28 counts. Walker, the only instructor who has been accused of sexually assaulting another airman, faces life in prison if convicted. His civilian attorney, Joseph Esparza, has declined to speak with reporters and did not return multiple calls for comment. Sexual assault victims are reassigned and can apply for a 'humanitarian discharge' from the military, but Lackland civilian spokeswoman Collen McGhee said she did not know whether those affected by this case had done so.","Allegations that male instructors had sex with, and in one case raped, female trainees have led to criminal charges against four men.

14,"(CNN) -- The memory unit that may tell why an Air France jet plunged into the Atlantic nearly two years ago was recovered from the bottom of the ocean Sunday, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said. A remote-controlled submarine, known as the Remora 6000, located the memory unit Sunday morning and it was lifted on board the search ship Ile de Sein six hours later, the Paris-based BEA said. All 228 people aboard the Air France Flight 447 were killed when the plane fell into the ocean on the way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on June 1, 2009. The submarine found the orange-colored flight data recorder's chassis Wednesday, the second day of an operation that also hopes to retrieve bodies from the wreckage site. The memory unit was part of the recorder, but was not attached when it was found. The flight recorder chassis is found last week . The finds come more than three weeks after search teams found the tail section of the Airbus A330. Air France, in a written statement Sunday, called the discovery ""very significant."" ""We hope that the BEA, in charge of the technical investigation, will be able to provide answers to questions that relatives of the victims, Air France and the entire airline industry have been asking for nearly two years as to why this tragic accident occurred,"" the airline's statement said. A British aviation consultant said he is skeptical about how useful the memory unit will be to investigators, considering it has been sitting between 2,000 to 4,000 meters (6,562 to 13,124 feet) below the ocean's surface for 23 months. ""If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split and you have the corrosive effects of seawater and the depths involved,"" Phil Seymour, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, said Thursday.

""It may be that the more wreckage they find will help them to piece it all together, which bit by bit could help them build a picture of what caused the plane to come down,"" Seymour said. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based BEA, says there is a good chance the memory unit, which records any instructions sent to the aircraft's electronic systems, will still hold retrievable data. The Airbus A330's pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. Q&A: Will mystery ever be solved? But exactly what caused the plane to plunge into the sea has remained a mystery, with only small portions of the wreckage and a handful of bodies found in the remote area where it went down.

15,"By . James  Nye . Under mounting pressure to speak out about the controversy that has engulfed the department store this week, the rap mogul released a lengthy statement on his website after an online petition called for him to bow out of his upcoming partnership with Barneys. The Manhattan superstore stands accused of profiling two young black people, calling the police on both after they purchased expensive items. The rapper has signed a contract to design an exclusive line for Barneys that will be available next month. But Jay-Z - whose real name is Shawn Carter - defended himself, saying that he hasn't spoken about it because he's still trying to figure out exactly what happened. 'I move and speak based on facts and not emotion,' the statement said. Scroll Down for Video . Speaking out: Jay-Z has faced claims of supporting Barneys in the wake of their racial profiling scandal. The rapper says he is waiting to receive all the proper information before commenting or taking action, and that he has been demonized for doing so . Defending himself: Jay-Z reacts to increasing pressure in a statement on his website . 'I haven't made any comments because I am waiting on facts and the outcome of a meeting between community leaders and Barneys. 'Why am I being demonized, denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately?' 'I am not making a dime from this collection ... I need to make that fact crystal clear. The Shawn Carter Foundation is the beneficiary ... This money is going to help individuals facing socio-economic hardships to help further their education at institutions of higher learning. 'I am against discrimination of any kind, but if I make snap judgements, no matter who it’s towards, aren’t I committing the same sin as someone who profiles? 'I am no stranger to being profiled and I truly empathize with anyone that has been put in that position.' The statement came after residents of Marcy House, in Brooklyn, where Jay-Z grew up, called on the '99 Problems' rapper and husband of Beyonce to think about those who have not become as succesful as him.'Jay Z and my son grew up together,' said Effie Hardy, 74, to the New York Daily News. 'That could be his family Barneys is profiling. They would’ve done the same thing to him back in the day, before he got to where he is now. He should remember that.' The luxury and exclusive collection that Jay-Z has lent his considerable clout to is named 'A New York Holiday,' and the cheapest item is a $70 cotton T-shirt, while a Shawn Carter watch by Hublot with alligator skin straps will cost $33,900. Expensive: Items available from Jay-Z's new exclusive line at Barneys called 'A New York Holiday' - which has products available for tens of thousands of dollars . Another Marcy resident, Annette Rush, 40, told the New York Daily News that as a role model, Jay-Z should think about the ramifications of the two shoppers allegations. 'My money is as good as anybody else’s money. It’s all green,' said Rush. 'From someone that came from the hood, he should know all that. He knows how hard it is. I don’t think he should sell his things there, not at a place where there’s racial profiling going on. It’s ridiculous.' The controversy began when two black customers came forward to say that they had been stopped and detained after buying expensive items from the luxury store. Anger: Social media vented its dismay towards Jay-Z and one user attempted to link the Trayvon Martin case and the profiling of two customers at Barneys . Evocative: This Twitter user tries to invoke Jay-Z's paternal instincts by questioning how he would feel if his daughter was racially profiled as it is alleged the NYPD and Barneys profiled two black customers . On Tuesday, Trayon Christian, 19, from Queens said that he was suing the city and Barneys after he was accosted by two undercover NYPD detectives after he had bought a $349 Ferragamo belt. And then on Wednesday, Kayla Phillips, 21, a seven-month pregnant mother from Canarsie, Brooklyn, said that she too had been stopped. The young mother, from Brooklyn, New York, said she experienced similarly shocking treatment from staff at the Madison Avenue store in February when she bought a $2,500 Céline handbag. She has now filed a $5 million notice of claim with the city showing her intention to sue the NYPD. 'As I was walking into the train station, four undercover police officers attacked me,' Phillips told the New York Post. 'They were very rough,' she added to the New York Daily News. 'I didn't know what was happening.' She explained to the cops that she had used a temporary Bank of America card to make the purchase - and they demanded to know why her name was not on it. Complaint: Kayla Phillips, 21, says cops demanded to know how she could afford to buy a $2,500 Céline bag from Barneys in New York - in a case that echoes that of a teen accusing the store of racial profiling . Shock: She called her mother Wendy Straker (right with Kayla) who said she heard police ask her daughter: 'What are you doing here in Manhattan? Where'd you get the money to buy that expensive bag?' She called her mother, Wendy Straker, who said that the police officers had asked her daughter: 'What are you doing here in Manhattan? Where'd you get the money to buy that expensive bag?' Straker added that the police were on the phone with a Barneys employee about the transaction. Police finally let her go after she showed them her ID and new debit card, which arrived that morning. 'Jay Z is getting ready to do a campaign with Barneys, but they’re looking at these African-American kids like they're thieves,' Straker said. The case comes after it emerged that another shopper, Trayon Christian, was stopped and handcuffed after he bought a $350 Salvatore Ferragamo belt in the store. Treat: She had just bought a $2,500 orange suede Céline handbag when she was stopped by cops . Christian, 19, has now filed a lawsuit for unspecified damages against the Madison Avenue store and the NYPD who wrongly accused him of fraud. Mr Christian, who lives with his mom in Queens, had decided to splash out on the belt after seeing one of his favorite music stars, Harlem rapper Juelz Santana, wearing the accessory. However once he had paid for the belt and had left Barneys on April 29 this year, the fashion-loving teen was grabbed by undercover officers on the street. According to the civil rights lawsuit, the 19-year-old was asked 'how a young black man such as himself could afford to purchase such an expensive belt'. Mr Christian's lawyer Michael Palillo told the New York Daily News: 'He's never been arrested. His only crime was being a young black guy buying a $300 belt.' Trayon Christian, 19, has brought a lawsuit against Barneys and the NYPD after they wrongly accused him of fraud when he purchased a designer belt . Barneys department store is facing a lawsuit after a 19-year-old black student claims he was wrongly grabbed by store detectives because of his color and accused of stealing a designer belt . A Barneys store employee had asked the 19-year-old for ID when he used his Chase debit card to buy the belt. Mr Christian showed the clerk his state ID. Harlem rapper Juelz Santana (pictured right) wearing the belt coveted by his teenage fan . The store cashier then subsequently called the police to claim that the purchase was a fraud, according to the lawsuit. Officers took the teenager to a local precinct. Mr Christian once again showed his ID, debit card and receipt for the belt. Officers still refused to believe the teenager. Finally Chase bank was contacted who verified that the debit card belonged to Mr Christian. It was only then that he was allowed to go after spending two hours in a holding cell, the suit claims. The NYPD denied this and said the student was only held for 42 minutes. The student, who has no history of arrests, said that he will never shop at Barneys again following the incident. A Barney's New York spokesman said: 'Barneys New York typically does not comment on pending litigation. 'In this instance, we feel compelled to note that after carefully reviewing the incident of last April, it is clear that no employee of Barneys New York was involved in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale. 'Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand by our long history in support of all human rights.'","The rapper has signed a contract to design an exclusive line for Barneys that will be available next month.

16,"Police should face time limits on how long a person can languish on bail without being charged, the Home Secretary will say today. Theresa May is demanding action amid mounting anger that police forces are abusing their powers by keeping people in a legal limbo for ‘months or even years’ – only to be told they would not face any action. The issue has been highlighted by a number of high-profile cases, including celebrities and journalists, who have been left on bail for long periods – often with strict curbs to their freedom – without charges being pressed. Theresa May is demanding action amid mounting anger that police forces are abusing their powers by keeping people in a legal limbo for ‘months or even years’ Last week, the veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini, arrested in October last year by officers from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched in the wake of the late Sir Jimmy Savile being unmasked as a prolific paedophile, was informed he would not face sexual assault charges. The DJ, who was investigated over historic allegations of molesting two teenage boys, told of his ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ having his name dragged through the mud. The College of Policing, the professional body that sets police standards, has expressed concern over suspects being repeatedly re-bailed as it appears to be being used as a ‘quasi-judicial punishment’. Last week, veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini (left), arrested in October last year by officers from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched in the wake of the late Sir Jimmy Savile (right) being unmasked as a paedophile . The organisation has just concluded a review into how police and other law enforcement agencies use pre-charge bail in criminal investigations. But in a speech to the College’s annual conference in Coventry, Mrs May will order it to consult on introducing time limits on how long a person can spend on bail. Acknowledging it was a ‘sensitive area’, she said: ‘We must also look at statutory time limits on the use of pre-charge bail to prevent people spending months or even years on bail only for no charges to be brought.’ Mrs May declined to propose a possible time limit, but human rights group Liberty and the Law Society have suggested 28 days. Police are allowed 24 hours to keep a suspect for questioning after arrest before seeking a further period of detention from a judge. In practice, they often quiz a person then release them on pre-charge bail to return for further interview at a later date, giving officers time to build robust cases. But there are currently no restrictions on the length of time a person can spend on police bail which can force innocent people to put their lives on hold, pay thousands in legal fees and suffer the slow assassination of their characters. Conditions can also be placed on police bail, which can include curfews and restrictions on movement and financial transactions while an investigation continues. Comedian Jim Davidson (left) lashed out at the system after being kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges. Freddie Starr (right), another comedian, spent 19 months on bail after being arrested by officers investigating decades-old sex allegations made by 14 women . Comedian Jim Davidson lashed out at the system after being arrested under the Operation Yewtree and kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges. Freddie Starr, another comedian, spent 19 months on bail after being arrested by police investigating decades-old sex allegations made by 14 women. The case was dropped. Conservative MP Nigel Evans – who resigned as House of Commons deputy speaker before being cleared of sex assault charges in court in April – described the ‘indescribable torment, torture and stress’ of being left hanging on bail. He was eventually acquitted by a court of all charges of sexually assaulting Parliamentary researchers. Some 30 journalists are currently on bail – some for more than a year – while police investigate alleged crimes including phone hacking and paying public officials for stories. A Freedom of Information request in May last year found more than 57,000 people were on police bail at the time with more than 3,000 bailed for more than six months. Lord Macdonald, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, said recently: ‘There is sometimes a lack of urgency in police bail cases that is very worrying. Lives are put on hold and grave reputational damage goes unchecked, sometimes for years.’ Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, raised the issue during an evidence session with Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions. Referring to the 30 journalists on bail who do or did work for The Sun or now-defunct News of the World, he said: ‘They have been bailed and rebailed without being charged and have had their careers ruined because they have been suspended or lost their jobs. ‘It can’t be right that these people keep getting bailed and re-bailed.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Theresa May is demanding action amid mounting anger that police forces are abusing their powers by keeping people in a legal limbo for ‘months or even years’ The issue has been highlighted by a number of high-profile cases, including celebrities and journalists who have been left on bail for long periods.",850,51,0.486,0.922

The idea was to damage a vital source of power to the key industrial area of Germany. The strategic targets not only supplied hydro-electric power, and water for steel-making, but also supplied drinking water. The squadron was assembled by Wing .

18,"Andy Murray knows there can be no let up in his quest to secure a place at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals as he heads to Valencia on the back of a hard-earned victory over David Ferrer in the final of the Erste Open in Vienna. The British number one recovered from losing the opening set to break serve three times in the decider and clinch a 5-7 6-2 7-5 victory in two hours and 40 minutes, which earned him crucial points in the Race to London. Murray, 27, is now the holder of the eighth and final qualifying berth for tournament hosted at The O2, with Tomas Berdych's win against Grigor Dimitrov in the final of the Stockholm Open later on Sunday consolidating the Czech's seventh position. Andy Murray lifts the Erste Open trophy in Vienna after a three set victory against David Ferrer . The Scot is now in position to reach the World Tour Finals after moving into the eighth qualifying position . The margins, though, are slim heading into the last two ranking events of the regular 2014 season, the Valencia Open 500, where Murray will play, and the Swiss Indoors Basel preceding the BNP Paribas Masters, which carries double the qualification points. Some six players are realistically left chasing the three remaining places, with Marin Cilic, who on Sunday won the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, qualified as a Grand Slam winner, from the US Open. 'The next few weeks are extremely important, everyone is playing next week,' said Murray on www.atpworldtour.com. 'I just need to win as many matches as possible to keep hold of the eighth spot or go higher.' Murray will now compete at the Valencia Open 500 as he bids to secure his position in London . Murray has been battling to regain top form again this year, the 2013 Wimbledon champion having fallen down the world rankings to number 11, but he claimed the inaugural Shenzhen Open title at the end of September and now after Vienna has some 30 ATP Tour wins. He added on BBC Radio Five Live: 'I was starting to feel good at the US Open a few months ago and I wanted to try and continue that through until the end of the year. 'Obviously, London would be very nice if I can get there, but it is also important for seedings at the Australian Open. 'To be seeded in the top eight there can make a big difference to the draw and hopefully I will be able to do that.' David Ferrer, pictured playing a backhand shot against Murray, could also make the World Tour Finals . Ferrer, meanwhile, still harbours genuine hopes of making it to London - the Spaniard is currently in ninth place but only 100 points behind the Scot going into Valencia. 'I have reached the final (here), so it is positive,' said Ferrer, who had beaten Murray in the third round of last week's Shanghai Rolex Masters. 'Andy played more aggressively than I did in the crucial moments and he deserved to win. 'Of course, I am disappointed as I lost the match having had a 5-3 lead (in the third set). 'I have a chance (to qualify for London). There are two more weeks, which are important to get to London. I will try and be more positive next week.'",Andy Murray beat David Ferrer 5-7 6-2 7-5 in the final of the Erste Open in Vienna.

19,"A lifelong dream becomes reality for Chris Cork in Buenos Aires on Sunday, as the former punk rocker from High Wycombe sits on his bike to begin the world’s most punishing motorsport event. The 43-year-old Englishman, a builder by trade, will put his bike, body and possibly even his life on the line during the Dakar, the 5,500-mile race across the Andes and the Atacama desert. He has left his partner and two sons, including three-month-old Oliver, behind and even sold their farm to fund his ride of a lifetime. Chris Cork is set to embark on the the 5,500-mile Dakar race across the Andes and the Atacama desert . Cork, a builder by trade, has left his partner and two sons to embark on his race of a lifetime . ‘He’s always wanted to do the Dakar, it’s been a dream of his,’ said partner Mel, who remains confident, if a little anxious. ‘He’s quite a safe rider, it’s just everything else that goes into the equation that worries me. It’s a bit of a mixed bag because I’m excited for him but obviously it’s a bit tricky here for the next three weeks with two young kids.’ And that’s also the hardest part for Cork, who once upon a time played drums and bass in punk bands Chineapple Punx and Blossom, but nowadays is found doting on Mel and the children. ‘I have pictures of my two sons with me at all times and I miss them greatly,’ he said. Thoughts of home will disappear on Sunday, however, when Cork lines up at the start of one of the most gruelling and dangerous of all races. A total of 665 competitors will leave Buenos Aires in cars and trucks and on quad bikes and motorcycles. British interest is restricted to a mere eight racers, a far cry from the heyday of the old Paris-Dakar when dozens of home hopefuls would cross the Channel and begin the epic journey down to Dakar in Senegal. Cork will be one of 665 competitors racing in in cars and trucks and on quad bikes and motorcycles . Cork, whose preparations for the rally have not been ideal - he broke his wrist in August and crashed out of the Rally of Morocco in October - is Britain’s only amateur rider this year, though Paul Round from Huddersfield and Mike Jones, from Sandbach, founders of Rally Raid UK, continue to fly the flag in all categories, taking four cars, two trucks and two bikes. Crossing the barren terrain of Argentina, Chile and Bolivia sounds daunting enough, but Jones paints an even scarier picture. ‘The Dakar is an addiction, it takes over your life,’ he explained. ‘The organisation are out to break you and your vehicle, simple as that. ‘Some of the terrain looks mind blowing when you see it and you never believe a vehicle can cross it, let alone at speed. ‘You can be 3km off track and still be classed as on course, yet a 10-metre deviation in the desert can be a smooth fast track or a 500ft-deep canyon. The route designer puts secret waypoints that must be passed by into the most devilish places, at the top of the steepest dunes and the bottom of the biggest holes and sand pits. ‘In the daylight it is difficult, when the sun goes down it really sorts the men from the boys or the girls from the women.’ 43-year-old's preparations have been far from ideal having broken a wrist in August . Of the eight British competitors at Dakar this year it is with Cork’s sole compatriot in the bike category, Sam Sunderland, where British hopes lie. Sunderland, 25, has secured a ride with the dominant KTM squad, on the back of taking the second stage win riding a works Honda in last year’s Dakar. For Cork, however, ambitions are more modest. Given what lies ahead, the endless tests over unyielding surfaces, in extreme temperatures, from sea level to the peaks of the Andes and back, he speaks for the majority when he says: ‘My expectation is simply to finish.’ Britain's Sam Sunderland will be riding at Dakar with the dominant KTM squad .","Chris Cork is set to embark on the 5,500-mile Dakar race across the Andes and the Atacama desert.
